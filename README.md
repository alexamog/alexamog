Hi 👋 My name is Alexander
==========================

IT student @ BCIT | Previous SWD, SRE @ Government of Canada
-----------------------------------------

I am currently a student at British Columbia Institute of Technology pursuing the Information Technology program. I have experience in the technology industry as I have recently finished my eight month co-op program with the Government of Canada as a Software Developer and Site Reliability Engineer.

In the near future, I aspire to be a full-time Developer living comfortably with two cats 🐈 🐈‍⬛

During my free time, I either spend time working on projects or tinkering with custom mechanical keyboards. ⌨️
