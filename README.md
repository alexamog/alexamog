Hi 👋 My name is Alexander

Recent graduate of the Information Technology program at British Columbia Institute of Technology and have completed an eight-month co-op program with the Government of Canada, where I gained experience as a Software Developer and Site Reliability Engineer. 🤓 ⌨️ 

In the near future, I aspire to be a full-time Developer living comfortably with two cats 🐈 🐈‍⬛

During my free time, I either spend time working on projects or tinkering with custom mechanical keyboards. ⌨️ 🪛
